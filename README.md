<li>Hope your will have a good experience with this site...</li>


<p>Programming one day at a time,
enjoying one function at a time;
accepting bugs as a pathway to code complete;
taking this terrible codebase as it is;
not as I would have it;
trusting that all things will be made right
if I surrender to writing tests and documentation;
so that I may be reasonably happy at the end of the day
and somewhat sane at the end of this release.</p># tourism-or-delivery-website-client-side-Imdadulislam
